**Groupie Trackers**

Groupie Trackers is a web application designed to interact with a given API to manipulate and display data. The API consists of four main parts:

1.  **Artists**: Contains information about bands and artists, including names, images, start year, first album date, and members.
2.  **Locations**: Lists their last and/or upcoming concert locations.
3.  **Dates**: Provides their last and/or upcoming concert dates.
4.  **Relation**: Connects the artists, dates, and locations.

The goal is to create a user-friendly website that visualizes the artists' information through various formats such as blocks, cards, tables, lists, and graphics.

A key feature of the project involves implementing client-server communication, where the client triggers actions that request information from the server, following a request-response model.

**Instructions:**

-   The backend must be written in Go.
-   Ensure the site and server are stable and error-free.
-   Adhere to best coding practices.
-   Unit testing is recommended.
-   Only standard Go packages are allowed.

**Learning Objectives:**

-   Data manipulation and storage
-   Handling JSON files and formats
-   HTML for web development
-   Event creation and display
-   Understanding client-server interactions
